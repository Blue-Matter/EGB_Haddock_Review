### Software

&nbsp;

#### Wood's Hole Assessment Model (WHAM)

For more information about WHAM you can go to [the WHAM homepage](https://brianstock.github.io/wham/)

or read the peer-reviewed paper by [Stock and Miller 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783621000953)

&nbsp;

#### OpenMSE

For more information about the OpenMSE software (Hordyk et al.) used in reference point calculation, projection and plan-B testing visit [the openMSE homepage](https://openMSE.com). 

The operating model equations are identical to those detailed in the appendices of the peer-reviewed paper for DLMtool [Carruthers & Hordyk 2019](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13081)

### R Code 

R code for TOR 4 (Assessment), TOR 6 (Projection), TOR 8 (Plan - B assessment), TOR 11 (Reference points) is available from a [private GitHub repository](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/EGB_Haddock/)

Please email tom@bluematterscience or failing that, quang@bluematterscience for access to the repository. 

The repo has the following folder structure:

<img src="img/repo.JPG" width="500">


```{r ProjDets, eval=T}
dat<-data.frame(c("/Data","/Figures","/Tables","/TOR 4 i - Standard SCA","/TOR 4 ii - Time Varying Survival","/TOR 4 iii - Sim testing","/TOR 4 iv - Base EGB model","/TOR 4 v - Fit Retro Estimates","/TOR 4 vi - Sensitivity Base EGB","/TOR 6 Projections","/TOR 8 - Plan B EGB","/TOR 11 i - Make EGB OM","/TOR 11 ii - Reference points EGB", "/VPA","/WHAM","/Z - Old scripts"),

                 c("Raw and processed data used in the fitting of assessments and production of operating models",
                   "TOR 4, 6, 8 and 11 Figures",
                   "TOR 4, 6, 8 and 11 Tables",

                   "Code and documentation for the continuity VPA run",
                   "Additional code and data to support EGB assessment",
                   "Disused code for reference"))

kable(dat,col.names=c("Folder","Contents")) 
 

```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


Within each folder there are calculation scripts starting a_, b_ etc and then source code, Tabulation and Figure scripts (x_, y_, z_).

<img src="img/infolder.JPG" width="500">

To run through the various analyses, first run the Dependencies.R script in the base directory.

The correct order to run through the scripts from scratch is:

* TOR 4 i-vi (assessment) 
* TOR 11 i & ii (reference points), 
* TOR 6 (projections - uses operating model and reference points from TOR 11)
* TOR 8 (plan B - uses operating model and reference points from TOR 8)

### Further details on the Base (Mest) model

A full set of detailed diagnostics and model estimates are available in the form of the default wham plotting figures which are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AgzaUH1UK0_JPme2MCRSvpI1wTHroNKS?usp=sharing)
